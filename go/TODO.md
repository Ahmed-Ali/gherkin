# To Do List

- [x] keep everything in one `gherkin3` package without any dependencies
- [x] remove code snippet comments 
- [x] change multi-value return statements to return the error as last value, as it's done in the golang stdlib
- [x] only make public what needs to be public, check with go doc what makes sense
- [ ] use package `gherkin` (remove the 3)
- [ ] make split repository *go get-able*: `go get github.com/cucumber/gherkin-go`
